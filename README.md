#**Piano Generation Using Deep Learning**

This repository contains code, notebooks and a GUI application for exploring and experimenting with various deep learning architectures to generate piano music. The experiments include recurrent architectures (GRU, LSTM), encoder-decoder models, transformer-based fine-tuning (DistilGPT-2), and GAN-based approaches.
